# Descriptive Item Names

Adds a short description to every item name to help players unfamiliar with every item understand what they do.

I hate remembering all the items.

Note: Might not work with RoRCheats

## Examples

* Cautious Slug (Heal Out of Combat)
* Wax Quail (Sprint Jump Boost)
* N'kuhana's Opinion (Fire Skulls When Healed)
* Fuel Cell (+Equipment Charge)
